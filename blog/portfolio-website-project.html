            <p>
                When I started this portfolio website, I swore I’d keep everything clean, modular, and elegant. 
                Then I actually built it. The file and project structure ended up looking like it was organized 
                by a raccoon who just discovered Tailwind—folders within folders, a few “final-final-3” filenames, 
                and components I definitely meant to refactor. But here’s the twist: I’m still proud of it. Underneath 
                the mess, this little project taught me a lot about design, data, conversation, and—most importantly—shipping 
                something real to the web.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The first big lesson was that visual polish isn’t a luxury; it’s table stakes for keeping people on the page. 
                I focused on simple, repeatable patterns that make a site feel intentional: clear heading hierarchy so your 
                eyes always know where to land, consistent spacing so nothing looks crammed or lonely, and readable line lengths 
                so paragraphs don’t feel like marathons. I added small hover states and gentle shadows to give the interface a 
                bit of life without turning it into a carnival ride. Most of all, I tried to keep actions obvious: functional 
                buttons, links that actually look like links, and focus states that make keyboard navigation pleasant. Accessibility 
                wasn’t something I sprinkled on at the end, either; alt text, labels, and color contrast made it in early. 
                Clarity beats fancy every time.

                <img src="/assets/images/Portfolio-blog-post-pics/GA4_Dashboard.jpg"
                    alt="Google Analytics Dashboard showing site visitors"
                    class="rounded-x1 shadow-lg w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                <figcaption class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-500 text-center">
                    My first traffic spike in GA4 - proof that people were actually visiting.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Because I wanted to build for real people, I wired up Google Analytics. I’m using GA4 to see which pages people 
                visit, how long they stick around, and which links they actually click. I even added a couple of custom events—like 
                tracking resume downloads—so I can tell whether visitors are kicking the tires or really interested. I’m not collecting 
                anything creepy; it’s just enough data to stop me from guessing. Honestly, one of the most exciting moments was 
                seeing those first visits show up in the dashboard—it made the site feel alive in a way code alone never could. 
                Seeing real numbers has already changed how I prioritize work
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Opening the door to conversation was another milestone. I added Giscus for comments, which hooks into GitHub 
                Discussions under the hood. It’s a neat setup: threaded conversations, reactions, and spam protection with 
                almost no maintenance. The trick was mapping each page to a unique discussion based on its pathname, and once 
                I did that, it just worked. The only catch is that you need a GitHub account to comment, which is fine for most 
                devs but not ideal for everyone. To make sure no one felt shut out, I included alternate ways to reach me—because 
                a conversation isn’t a conversation if only half the room can talk.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Then came the part that makes a project feel “real”: getting it online with a custom domain. 
                I deployed with GitHub Pages and pointed my domain at the repo. That meant flipping the right 
                switch in the repo settings, adding the recommended DNS records with my registrar, and dropping 
                a CNAME file in the project so the domain sticks during redeploys. DNS propagation has a sense 
                of humor and takes its sweet time, but once it clicked, seeing my own URL load something I built 
                was ridiculously satisfying. It’s a small thing that makes a big difference in how professional the site feels.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Now, about that messy structure. I’m not going to pretend it’s ideal, but shipping first taught me what 
                actually needs cleaning. I can already see the wins I’ll get from pulling repeated UI into reusable components, 
                tidying assets into a sane set of folders, and moving blog content into Markdown so writing doesn’t involve 
                spelunking through HTML. I’ll keep trimming image sizes, tuning meta tags, and smoothing performance. The 
                difference this time is that I’m refactoring with purpose instead of chasing abstract neatness. It turns out 
                “done” is a fantastic teacher.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <p>
                If I could time-travel a few weeks and give myself advice, I’d say: begin with the essentials and expand gradually; 
                choose a simple design system early and stick to it; add analytics once you have content live and let the data guide 
                you; keep comments lightweight and friendly to encourage community; and spring for the custom domain because it’s 
                the cheapest, fastest way to level up your site’s presence. Most importantly, don’t wait for perfect. Ship, learn, 
                then polish.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                I’m still improving this portfolio, but I’m already grateful for the lessons it taught me: clarity over flash, 
                data over guesswork, conversations over silence, and progress over perfection. If you have tips for tidying 
                structure without losing momentum, clever analytics events I should track, or a Giscus trick I haven’t discovered 
                yet, I’d love to hear them. And if you notice a stray “final-final-2.png” lurking in the repo… let’s agree to 
                pretend it’s a performance art piece.
