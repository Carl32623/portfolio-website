            <p>
                So, it’s Saturday. FedEx. Overtime. That magical combo where you trade your weekend soul for a slightly fatter paycheck. 
                I don’t always work Saturdays, but hey, extra money means extra… well, probably gas and groceries, let’s be honest.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Anyway, I had this <strong>First Overnight</strong> package due by 10:30 a.m. Easy. No sweat. 
                Except—plot twist—it was actually due at 10:00. Cue dramatic music. By 9:30, I realized the mistake and gunned 
                it across town like Vin Diesel in a 1970 Dodge Charger R/T.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                I pull up to this mansion. You know the type. Driveway shaped like a NASCAR track, door the size of King Kong’s 
                forehead, house so big you wonder if the Roombas inside have unionized. Being the rule-following delivery hero 
                I am, I parked on the street and hoofed it up the driveway. Exercise is free, after all.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                That’s when I saw them. The <em>squad</em>. Seven or eight wild turkeys, casually strutting out of the 
                backyard like they just finished shooting a music video. They’re far enough away, so I think nothing of it. 
                (Mistake number one.) 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                I make the drop, turn back toward my truck, and—bam—two turkeys break formation and head straight for me. 
                I figure, “No problem, just walk around them.” Except one decides to do the whole <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger flex</strong>, 
                puffs up like a balloon, and starts screaming turkey expletives at me.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                So naturally, I do what any mature adult would do: I puff up back. (Mistake number two. Massive mistake number two.) 
                This feathered Terminator takes it as a declaration of war and charges. Full speed.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                I have never, in my 42 years of life, been chased by a turkey. Let me tell you: they are terrifyingly fast. 
                Like, Usain Bolt-with-wings fast. I’m suddenly sprinting down the driveway like a man who actually enjoys cardio. 
                I leap into my truck, slam the door, and sit there gasping like I just ran the Boston Marathon.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                And then… I realize I’m surrounded. The entire turkey mob has closed in on my truck, circling it, like some kind 
                of poultry version of <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>. I start the engine—diesel roar, very intimidating. The turkeys? 
                Unmoved. Just glaring. Judging. Probably plotting.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                I finally inch away, avoiding vehicular turkeyslaughter, only to see in my rearview mirror… the ringleader. 
                The bold one. The Arnold. <strong>Still chasing me down the street</strong>. This bird was not giving up. 
                I swear he was gaining on me.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                So I did the only thing I could. I shook my fist triumphantly out the window, like some kind of cartoon 
                villain, and yelled, “I’ll be back in two months!” Because, you know… Thanksgiving. It felt like the perfect 
                action-movie one-liner.
            </p>
            <br>
    
            <p>
                I can only hope the customer’s Ring doorbell caught it all, because if I’m going to be humiliated, 
                I want it on YouTube with at least a million views.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                <strong>Moral of the story:</strong> Don’t mess with turkeys. They’re faster, meaner, and way better at cardio than you.
            </p>
