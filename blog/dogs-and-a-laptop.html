    <p>
      Earlier last week, I came home from a 10-hour work day dreaming about dinner, a shower, and my lazy chair. 
      Instead, I walked into an active crime scene: two very happy dogs, one very unhappy side table, and a laptop 
      that had just explored the concept of gravity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Was this an accident? A coordinated enrichment activity? An unsanctioned QA stress test? All I know is there 
        was a squeaky toy pronounced legally deceased, a tail operating at helicopter speeds, and my laptop doing its 
        best impression of a mic drop. That one’s on me—I parked a computer on a launchpad disguised as a living room.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>The Triage</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Step one: push the power button like it owes me money. Nothing.<br>
        Step two: remember I have OneDrive backups.<br>
        Step three: discover that restoring a life’s worth of files from OneDrive feels like a boss level with 17 unskippable cutscenes.<br>
        <br>
        Yes, the files returned. No, my sanity did not. There were version conflicts, partial syncs, and a folder that quantum-blinked in 
        and out of existence like it was auditioning for a Marvel cameo. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>Shiny New Laptop</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      On the bright side, I am now the new owner of an MSI Katana 17 Laptop. Top of the line? No. 
      Do I have games to play? Absolutely (we’ll get into that at a later date). And it boots faster 
      than it takes my dogs to realize I opened the cheese drawer. But this whole experience reminded 
      me of a previous thought over topic: <strong>build a home NAS</strong>, so that my data lives on my network, in 
      my home, with backups that don’t depend on the mood swings of a cloud. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>The NAS Plan</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Here’s the dream board:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Centralized storage</strong> for projects, school work, photos—anything I don’t want yeeted off a side table.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic, versioned backups</strong> from laptops/phones (snapshots included, so I can undo my own heroics).</li>
        <li><strong>Redundancy (RAID)</strong> so a single drive failure is a <em>pit stop, not a tow truck</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Local speed:</strong> 1&nbsp;GbE minimum; 2.5&nbsp;GbE if I’m feeling dangerous—restores shouldn’t feel like mailing a letter to myself.</li>
        <li><strong>Offsite copy</strong> every night to a cloud bucket—coverage for fires, floods, and dogs who learn to use tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>The Setup...Hopefully</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      I’m keeping this simple and hard to break: a UGREEN 2-bay box with two matching NAS rated drives 
      (4-8TB each) in a RAID1 mirror, because when a disk dies I want a coffee break, not a kitchen fire. 
      I’ll add a 500 GB SSD for the OS and cache/app data (logs, packages, the nerdy bits that like fast I/O), 
      hang it on <strong>1–2.5 GbE</strong>, and back it with a small UPS so power disruptions don’t become data tragedy. 
      What it’ll do: <strong>centralize</strong> projects/school/photos (maybe a movie here and there), <strong>run automatic versioned 
      backups</strong> from laptops and phones, keep snapshots for easy rollbacks, and push a nightly encrypted offsite 
      copy to the cloud. UGREEN boxes usually ship with their own OS, but I’m tempted to try a <strong>Linux distro 
      (hello, Ubuntu)</strong> for the learning curve and flexibility.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Don’t store laptops on launchpads. Side tables next to a dog runway violates at least five OSHA rules.</li>
        <li>Test restore, not just backups. If you haven’t practiced, you don’t have a plan. </li>
        <li>Label everything for a confused Future You, because Future You will be confused.</li>
        <li>Cloud is great...until it isn’t.  It’s an excellent 2nd or 3rd copy solution. First copy should live on a box that you can touch.</li>
        <li>Buy the rubber feet, straps, and cable management now. It may not be glamorous but can be widely effective. Gravity is undefeated.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>The Dog Debrief</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      The suspects have been reprimanded with stern looks and several belly rubs. 
      They have expressed deep remorse by immediately taking a nap shaped like a croissant. Justice served.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>Your Turn</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        I know some of you have glorious home labs and NAS setups that could run a small moon base. 
        Help me not reinvent a worse wheel. What would you recommend?
    </p>
    <p>
        Bonus points for photos of your setup—and extra bonus points if your pets have also contributed to your disaster recovery plan.</p>
    <p>
        Thanks for reading! Next time I’ll write from a chair that’s nowhere near a canine slip ‘n slide.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>P.S.</strong></em> <em>If you’ve made OneDrive behave like a well-mannered butler, please share the ritual.</em>
