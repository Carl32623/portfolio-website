    <p>
      Since this is my very first blog post, I thought it’d be a good idea to start with a proper introduction.
      After all, if you’re going to be reading my ramblings, you should at least know who’s behind the keyboard.
      So buckle up.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Work Life: The FedEx Express Hustle</h2>
    <p>
      By day, I work full time as a courier for <strong>FedEx Express</strong>. My mornings usually start before
      the sun decides to show up, and during the winter months, they often end in the blackness of night. 
      It’s long hours on the road, but it’s also given me a front-row seat to the everyday hustle of the world — 
      from early risers chasing their day to night owls still wrapping up yesterday. 
      Somewhere in between, I’ve mastered the art of navigating traffic like it’s a video game! 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Student Life: Computer Science in Pajamas</h2>
    <p>
      By night (and most lunch breaks), I’m a <strong>Computer Science student</strong> pursuing my degree
      online at Southern New Hampshire University. My concentration is in Software Engineering, which basically
      means I spend a lot of time thinking about code, debugging code, and wondering why my code doesn’t work. 
      I'm in my senior year now, which means <strong>no more math!</strong>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Life at Home: Dogs & a Patient Wife</h2>
    <p>
      When I’m not hauling packages or pounding on the old keyboard, I’m at home in Livonia, Michigan with my wife
      and our two dogs, <strong>Dasha</strong> and <strong>Annabelle</strong>. 
      They keep things interesting—whether it’s surprise barking during study hours or "helping me
      'test' the durability of laptop."
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>What to Expect Here</h2>
    <p>
      This blog will be a mix of my experiences with online school, what I am learning, how I am applying
      that knowledge to my personal projects, and the occasional mishap with the dogs.
      I’ll share the good, the bad, and the ever-so-often “why won’t this compile?” moments. 
      Hopefully it’ll help other students or developers, or at least provide some amusement.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by—and here’s to figuring this out together. If you are one who balances work,
      school, and two noisy dogs, drop a comment or reach out-I'd love to hear your story.
