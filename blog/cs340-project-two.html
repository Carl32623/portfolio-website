    <h1>CS-340 Project Two: Building a Rescue-Dog Dashboard</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Aug 2025 • 6–8 min read</p>
    <br>

    <p>
      For my CS-340 Client/Server Development course, Project Two was to
      ship a small but real dashboard that helps <em>Grazioso Salvare</em>
      quickly find dogs suited for specific rescue scenarios using the
      Austin Animal Center Outcomes dataset. I connected a MongoDB data
      store to an interactive web UI so staff can filter animals, visualize
      top breeds, and see locations on a map—without touching the database.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>What I built</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      The dashboard has four main features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Filter buttons for <strong>Water Rescue</strong>, <strong>Mountain/Wilderness</strong>, and <strong>Disaster/Individual Tracking</strong> (plus Reset).</li>
      <li>A responsive data table that updates to match the chosen filter.</li>
      <li>A bar chart of “Top Breeds” for the current filter.</li>
      <li>An interactive map that auto-centers when you select an animal in the table.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That mix came straight from the project brief and my ReadMe for the deliverable, which also outlines the toolchain and MVC-ish design I used.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Stack & architecture</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MongoDB + PyMongo</strong> for storage and queries.</li>
      <li><strong>Dash</strong> (inside Jupyter via <code>jupyter-dash</code>) for the reactive web UI.</li>
      <li><strong>Plotly</strong> for the bar chart and <strong>dash-leaflet</strong> for the map.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
      Data access is wrapped in an <code>AnimalShelter</code> class that exposes simple
      <abbr title="Create Read Update Delete">CRUD</abbr> methods. The pattern keeps the UI
      callbacks clean and lines up nicely with the course’s MVC goals: MongoDB is the model,
      Dash callbacks are the controller, and the Dash layout is the view. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The <code>AnimalShelter</code> class handles <code>create</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code>
      with clear checks and helpful output—handy when you’re iterating on queries
      and need quick feedback. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Key interactions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Each rescue button triggers a query tailored to that scenario (e.g., age, breed, and outcome filters).
      When the results return:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The table renders only the matching animals.</li>
      <li>The “Top Breeds” bar chart recomputes from the filtered set.</li>
      <li>Selecting a row pans/zooms the map to that animal’s coordinates.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It’s a tight loop: pick a rescue profile → skim candidates → click one → see it on the map.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>What tripped me up (and how I fixed it)</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Coordinating multiple outputs.</strong> Dash callbacks are powerful, but you
        have to keep inputs/outputs straight. I split logic into small, single-purpose
        callbacks—one for table data, one for chart data, one for map state—then shared
        lightweight derived values between them.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Query drift.</strong> It’s easy for UI filters and server-side Mongo queries to
        get out of sync. I centralized the “filter spec” and generated the MongoDB query
        from that single object so the UI and DB stay aligned.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Geolocation edge cases.</strong> Not all rows had clean lat/long. I added
        basic validation so the map only places markers for valid coordinates, with a
        friendly message when none are available.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Designing to queries.</strong> UI is simpler when you start from “What question is the user asking the data?” then model the query and let the UI follow.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Document DBs shine with varied records.</strong> The AAC dataset’s shape fits MongoDB well, and PyMongo made quick work of CRUD and filters.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Small, composable callbacks > one giant function.</strong> It kept state bugs down and made testing bits in isolation easy.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Maps + charts boost decision speed.</strong> The moment you see “top breeds” and a pin on a map for the selected dog, the task clicks.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>What I’d improve next</h2><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Add server-side caching for popular filters to speed up first render.</li>
      <li>Bundle the app as a lightweight container so it can run outside Jupyter more easily.</li>
      <li>Expand rescue profiles (e.g., “Urban Search”) and expose their criteria in the UI.</li>
      <li>Basic auth and role-based views for staff vs. admin tasks.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>How to run it</h2><br>
    <p>
      The course deliverable runs in Jupyter with <code>jupyter-dash</code>, Dash, dash-leaflet, Plotly,
      and PyMongo against a MongoDB that holds the Austin Animal Center dataset.
      The ReadMe includes the quickstart and file list.
